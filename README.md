### About Xert
Xert is a tool for endurance athletes, cyclist and runners in particular, to analyze performance metrics. Amoung other things, Xert provides an Adapative Training Advisor that attempts to recommend specific details about optimal training for the present time. The recomendation is based on data from previous activities, the ammount of time before the next competition and the current fatigue status. 

### Library Objective
The primary reason for the library is to provide an alternative to the website presentations of some Xert features. For example Xert has a large collection of workouts designed
to address specific objectives characterized by certain workout parameters. The paramers are: **Focus Dificulity Duration and XSS** **X**ert **S**train **S**core). Some people fint the the current website presentation and filtering of the workouts less than ideal and a bit clumbsy. This library attempts to make using the for getting the workouts easy to implement on another platform

### See XertExplorer 
I a have created a prject that uses this dll to present the workouts and filter them in a way that is hopefully easier to use.
